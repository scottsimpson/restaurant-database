This document contains the queries demonstrated in Chapter 5.

### 05-01: Creating a Database
```SQL
CREATE DATABASE Restaurant;
```

```SQL
USE Restaurant;
```

### 05-02: Creating Tables
```SQL
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT(6) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    PRIMARY KEY(CustomerID)
);
```

```SQL
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT(6) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    FirstName VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(200),
    Address VARCHAR(200),
    City VARCHAR(200),
    State CHAR(2),
    Phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    Birthday DATE,
    FavoriteDish INT(6) REFERENCES Dishes(DishID),
    PRIMARY KEY(CustomerID)
);
```

### 05-03: Writing SQL Queries
```SQL
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Dishes;
```

```SQL
SELECT Name FROM Customers;
```

```SQL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Email FROM Customers;
```

### 05-04: Narrowing query results
```SQL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, State FROM Customers;
```

```SQL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, State FROM Customers WHERE State = "CA";
```

```SQL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, State FROM Customers WHERE State = "TX";
```

```SQL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, State FROM Customers WHERE State = "CA" OR State = "CO";
```

```SQL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, State FROM Customers WHERE State LIKE "C%";
```

```SQL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, State FROM Customers WHERE Name = "Taylor";
```

```SQL
SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName, State FROM Customers WHERE Name = "Taylor";
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Reservations WHERE Date > "2019-02-06" AND Date < "2019-02-07";
```

### 05-05: Sorting results
```SQL
SELECT * FROM Dishes ORDER BY `Name`;
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Dishes ORDER BY `Name` ASC;
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Dishes ORDER BY `Name` DESC;
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Dishes ORDER BY Price;
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Reservations ORDER BY `Date`;
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Reservations WHERE `Date` > "2019-02-06" AND `Date` < "2019-02-07" ORDER BY `Date`;
```

### 05-06: Aggregate functions
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(FirstName) FROM Customers;
```

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(FirstName) FROM Customers WHERE State = "CA";
```

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(State) FROM Customers WHERE State = "CA";
```

```SQL
SELECT SUM(Price) FROM Dishes;
```

```SQL
SELECT SUM(Price), AVG(Price) FROM Dishes;
```

```SQL
SELECT SUM(Price), AVG(Price), MIN(Price), MAX(Price) FROM Dishes;
```

### 05-07: Joining tables
```SQL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, FavoriteDish FROM Customers JOIN Dishes;
```

```SQL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, FavoriteDish FROM Customers JOIN Dishes ON Customers.FavoriteDish = Dishes.DishID;
```

```SQL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, FavoriteDish, Dishes.`Name` FROM Customers JOIN Dishes ON Customers.FavoriteDish = Dishes.DishID;
```

```SQL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, FavoriteDish, Dishes.DishID, Dishes.`Name` FROM Customers JOIN Dishes ON Customers.FavoriteDish = Dishes.DishID;
```

```SQL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Dishes.`Name` FROM Customers JOIN Dishes ON Customers.FavoriteDish = Dishes.DishID;
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Reservations;
```

```SQL
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Reservations.Date, Reservations.PartySize FROM Customers JOIN Reservations ON Reservations.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID ORDER BY Reservations.Date;
```

For MySQL:
```SQL
SELECT OrdersDishes.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate, Customers.FirstName, Customers.LastName, Customers.Phone, GROUP_CONCAT(Dishes.`Name` SEPARATOR ', ') AS Items, COUNT(OrdersDishes.DishID) AS Qty, SUM(Dishes.Price) AS Total
FROM OrdersDishes
JOIN Dishes on OrdersDishes.DishID = Dishes.DishID
JOIN Orders on Orders.OrderID = OrdersDishes.OrderID
JOIN Customers on Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
GROUP BY Orders.OrderID;
```

For SQLite:
_SQLite doesnâ€™t support the `SEPARATOR` keyword in `GROUP_CONCAT()`._
```SQL
SELECT OrdersDishes.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate, Customers.FirstName, Customers.LastName, Customers.Phone, GROUP_CONCAT(Dishes.`Name`, ', ') AS Items, COUNT(OrdersDishes.DishID) AS Qty, SUM(Dishes.Price) AS Total
FROM OrdersDishes
JOIN Dishes on OrdersDishes.DishID = Dishes.DishID
JOIN Orders on Orders.OrderID = OrdersDishes.OrderID
JOIN Customers on Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
GROUP BY Orders.OrderID;
```

### 05-08: Modifying data
```SQL
INSERT INTO Customers;
```

```SQL
INSERT INTO Customers (FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone) VALUES ("Jane", "Smith", "jsmith2019@landonhotel.com", "415-555-1234");
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE FirstName = "Taylor" AND LastName = "Jenkins";
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 1;
```

```SQL
UPDATE Customers SET Email = "tjenkins@landonhotel.com" WHERE CustomerID = 1;
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 1;
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE FirstName = "Taylor" AND LastName = "Jenkins";
```

```SQL
DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 26;
```

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```
